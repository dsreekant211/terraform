Installing Terraform
Installing Terraform is a relatively trivial affair. Simply head over to Terraform select your operating system and download the corresponding zip file. Once downloaded extract the file to a convienient location on your computer and add to your path.

Installing Terraform on Linux/Mac
Here I download Terrraform to my Downloads folder, extracted the zip file, moved it to /home/terraform/Documents/terraform and then updated the PATH environment variable pointing it to Terraform.

unzip terraform_0.9.11_linux_amd64.zip
Archive:  terraform_0.9.11_linux_amd64.zip
  inflating: terraform               
mv terraform ../Documents/terraform/
export PATH=$PATH:/home/terraform/Documents/terraform:$PATH
Verify Terraform is installed and working correctly.

terraform -version
Terraform v0.9.11
Success!

Installing Terraform on Windows
Here I created a folder called terraform in my C:\ then extracted the zip file. After that I updated the PATH environment variable pointing it to Terraform.

cd \
mkdir terraform
I then used 7-zip to extract the terraform.exe to c:\terraform

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\terraform
C:\terraform>terraform.exe -version
Terraform v0.9.11
